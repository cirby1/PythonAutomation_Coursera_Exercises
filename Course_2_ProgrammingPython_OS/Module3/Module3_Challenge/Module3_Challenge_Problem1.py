#1 - Which of the following functions are used to match a regular expression pattern in Python? Select all correct answers.
#A. re.match() - we never used anything that sounded like this...
#B. re.find() - we did not use anything that sounded like this either. We used re.findall().
#C. re.findall() - This is one function we used and it returned all the matches in a list I believe.
#D. re.search() - This is the first function that we used and it would search a string for a single best match

#I think it's C and D..
