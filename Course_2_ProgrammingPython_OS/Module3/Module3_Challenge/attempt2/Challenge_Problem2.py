#2 Which function from Python's re module can you use to replace old text with new text?

#str.replace() method - we did use string methods and this is completely out of context.

#re.findall() function - There was a findall() method and it just found all the matches of the regular expression.

#re.compile() function - There wasn't any compile method discussed.

#re.sub() function - I think it's the subsitute method. This one.
