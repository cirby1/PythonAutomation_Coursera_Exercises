#2 - In regular Expressions, what does the re.split() function do?
#A - Concatenates multiple strings into one string. - no it does combine anything. Wrong.
#B - Splits a string into a list of substrings based on a regular expression pattern. Yes this sounds right.
#C - Removes all occurences of a specified substring from a string. I do remember periods disappearing. If you split by a period that is. 
#D - Checks if a string contains a specified substring or not. I don't think so...

#My answer is B. It sounds the best.
