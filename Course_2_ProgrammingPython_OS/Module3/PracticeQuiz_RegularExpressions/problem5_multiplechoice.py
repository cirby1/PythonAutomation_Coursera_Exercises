#5. What does the plus character + do in regex?

A. Matches plus sign characters.

B. Matches one or more occurences of characters before it.

C. Matches the end of the string.

D. Matches the character before the + only if there is more than one.


A - Doesn't make sense, it's a special character, so you would have to escape it to just look for plus signs.
B - This is the most likely it looks for one or more of the preceding group.
C - Matches the end of the string. - I don't think so. I think $ is the character that does this.
D - Matches the character before the + only if there is more than one? - What the heck does this even mean??? So If there's multiple characters... What?

My vote is B.
