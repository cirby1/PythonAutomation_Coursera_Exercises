#7. A software engineer is tasked with developing a system that monitors network traffic and alerts administrators when suspicious activity is detected. The system receives a continuous stream of network traffic data, which needs to be processed and analyzed in real-time. The engineer is unsure of the best way to handle this high-volume data stream efficiently. What should the programmer do?

#A. Create one function to process the events and print the associated data to the screen. #Both A and B feel weird because I doubt someone would want to make something like this from scratch all over again. Maybe it's C, since you are leveraging what's already out there instead of reinventing the wheel. 

#B. Create 2 separate functions to process the events and print the associated data to the screen. 

#C. Use a third party library or tool designed for real-time data processing. #This is obvious as there's going to be a tool out there to handle these types of problems. 

#D. Increase the size of the database server. #I'm not sure how this would help. Probably not.
