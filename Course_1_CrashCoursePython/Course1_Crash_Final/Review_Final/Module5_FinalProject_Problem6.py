#6 - A system administrator is managing a network of computers. Each computer has a set of users who are currently logged in. The administrator wants to be able to quickly look up the current users of a given computer. Which data structure is the most efficient for storing the current users of each computer.

#What data structure is the most efficient? Well our project used a dictionary. Because it's changeable and mutable. 

#A set is not mutable and so new activity won't be able to be tracked.

#A tuple isn't mutable as well. At least I don't think. 

#A list is mutable, but I think a dictionary is faster than list.

#The last one is dictionary. Which I think is the best answer.
