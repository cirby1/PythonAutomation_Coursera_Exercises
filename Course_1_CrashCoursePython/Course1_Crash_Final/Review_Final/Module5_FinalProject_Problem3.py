#3. What is the sort() method used for in Python?

#My answer choices are:

#The sort() method returns the list from the code. *I don't think anything is returned. 

#The sort() method sorts a list without creating a new list. *I feel like this is one.

#The sort() method returns a new list that's been sorted. *I feel like this is the sorted function. 

#The sort() method creates a new list by sorting the strings or values in the original list. 

#I think it's answer B again.
