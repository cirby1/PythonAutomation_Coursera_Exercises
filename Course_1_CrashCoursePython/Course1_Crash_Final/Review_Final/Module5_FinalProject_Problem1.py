#1 - A programmer is working on a new project and encounters a complex problem. They are tempted to spend a lot of time trying to solve the problem on their own. However, a colleague advises them to research existing solutions first. What is the colleague's advise based on. 

#My answer choices are:

#The colleague believes that programming should not be innovative. *I don't think this is it. And it's kind of negative.

#The colleague believes that the programmer should not waste time reinventing something that already exists. *Maybe...Hmmm...

#The colleague believes that the programmer should not trust their own abilities to solve the problem. *Still really negative and definitely not it.  

#The colleague believes that the programmer should ask someone with more experience to solve this problem. *I don't think this is it either. 

#I think it's B. That the programmer shouldn't waste time on reinventing the wheel on something that already exists. It's a big waste of time.
