#9. A grocery store is developing a loyalty program to reward their customers based on their purchase history. The store wants to assign different reward tiers based on the total amount spent by each customer in the past year. To accomplish this, they need a conditional statement that will execute different blocks of code based on the customer's spending amount. What conditional statement is most suitable for this task. 

#A If Statement


#B elif Statement


#C and statement


#D true statement


#Well I think it's elif, howeer an If statement is absolutely needed still. But the way it reads is like it's looking at a bunch of options and picking the one that picks. Almost like a Switch Statement which would work really well here. I think it's B here.
