#5 Tuples and lists are very simlar types of sequences. What is the main thing that makes a tuple different from a list?
#A tuple is mutable.
#A tuple contains only numeric characters.
#A tuple is immutable.
#A tuple can contain only one type of data at a time.


#A tupe is mutable

mytuple = (1, 2)
print(mytuple)
#I'm still not sure

#A tuple is immutable. Related to the first answer.


#A A tuple contains only numeric characters.
mytuple2 = ("stuff", "stufff")
print(mytuple2)
#This is not true, as you can put actual text into the tuple.

#A tuple can only contain one type of data at a time.
mytuple3 = (1, "stuff")
print(mytuple3)
#This isn't true either, I just printed a tuple with a number and a string.

#The correct answer is that tuples are immutable and cannot be changed. Making lists the better choice, since you can have two item lists.
