Study Guide: Module 4 Graded Quiz

It is time to prepare for the Module 4 Graded Quizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz


Knowledge stuff:

    -How to output a list of the keys in a Python dictionary.
    -How to determine the output of a string index range used on a string.
    -Determine what a list should contain after the .insert() method is used on the list.
    -How to replace a specific word in a sentence with the same word in all uppercase letters.
    -How to use a dictionary to count the frequency of letters in a string.

Operations, Methods, and Functions.
String Methods, Operations, and Functions.
*****STRING METHODS***** STRINNGGGSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzz
-.upper() - this changes the entire string to upper case.
-.lower() - this changes the entire string to lower case.
-.split() - this splits the string by a charater I think. The default is a space. So it splits all the sentence by space.
-.format() - I like to think of this as the method that inserts other variables into the string. 
-.isnumeric() - I think this returns whether the string is a number or not. 
-.isalpha() - I think this returns whether a string is alphabetical characters or not. 
-.replace() - This will go through and replace old strings with new strings. And you can even put how many times you want to do this. 
-string index[] - you can add the brackets after the string name and put the index. Remember the index starts at 0. And it will output the character at that index. 
-len() - this outputs the length of the string. 
"""

"""
***LIST OPERATIONS***
.reverse() - When I ran this, it will reverse the elements in the list so that it is backwards. 
.extend() - You can put a bunch of individual elements at the end of the a list. Append() is just one element. 
.insert() - This is like a more specific inserter. You just say where do you want the new thing, and then you say what the new thing is that you want to insert.
.append() - this inserts a single thing at the end of the list. 
.remove() - It removes the single first occurence of the thing you tell it too. 
.sort() - This sorts the list in ascending order. 
List comprehensions [] - basically this allows you to apply some operations to each operation. 
List Comprehensions [] with if condition - Allows you to make more specific expressions. 
"""

"""
***Dictionary Operations and Methods.***
.items() - This creates a list of all the key, value terms and shows them in list format. 
.update() - It basically plugs in another dictionary and resorts the dictionary. 
.keys() - This just outputs the keys that are in the dictionary. That's it. 
.values() - This just outputs the values of all the keys in the dictionary. 
.copy() - This makes a legit copy of a dictionary, instead of a shallow reference since you cannot just simply assign the contents of one dictionary to another. 
dictionary[key] - This will output the value at where the key that you input where it says 'key' is specified. 
dictionary[key] = value, This will assign a value at where the key value is specified. It almost changes out one value for another.
