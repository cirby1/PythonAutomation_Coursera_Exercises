Reminder: Correct Syntax is critical.
Using precise syntax is critical when writing code in any programming language, including Python. Even a small typo can cause a syntax error and the automated Pythn-coded quiz grader will mark your code as incorrect. This reflects real life coding errors in the sense that a single error in spelling, case, punctuation, etc. can cause your code to fail. Coding probelsm caused by imprecise syntax will always be an issue whether you are learning a programming langayge or you are using programming skills on the job. So, it is critical to start the habit of being precise in your code now. No credit will be given if there are any coding errors on the automated graded quizzes - including minor errors. Fortunately you have 3 optional retake opportunities on teh graded quizzes in this course. Additionally, you have unlimted retakes on practice quizzes and can review the videos and readings as many times as you need to master the concepts in this course. 

Now, before starting the graded quiz, please review this list of common syntax errors coders make when writing code. 

Common Syntax Errors:
    -Misspellings
    -Incorrect Indentation, because flipping Python wants to use space instead of curly braces.
    -Missing key characters at the beginning or end of a section.
        -Like (, [, {, ", ', :
    -Data type mismatches
    -Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words.
    -Using the Wrong case (uppercase/lowercase), Python is a case-sensitive language.
